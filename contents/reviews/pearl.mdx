A 9/10 rating, you guessed right, it's **psychological horror.**

Our ghost is not traditional, she's strong, talented, headstrong, Pear is a **star**!
raising an alligator and chasing your dreams while taking care of your zombie father
and strict boring mother? must be tough, bet you couldn't compete.

The beauty of this movie is not about its unsettling atmosphere only, but the gripping
raising tension is what sets it apart. A minute passes another fleeting past your senses,
a scene builds by, tightening its grip around you, leaving you uneasily anticipating the
great horror.

Not only is this movie terrifying, it is also sad. Pearl knows she's not normal *(what is
normal anyways?)*, she can do nothing about it, nobody can help her, and so the horror goes on.
