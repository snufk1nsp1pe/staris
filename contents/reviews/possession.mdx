# Honest Opinion:
It was recommended to me by a very close person, and he had good taste for horror movies, i thought at first that it's the traditional horror, some ghost haunting its victims, but i was *wrong*.

It's my favourite genre; **psychological horror**. I fell in love. The eerie atmosphere, the raising questions with each cinematic scene, Izabella's lovely metro station mental break down after the squid she was seeing got her pregnant? impeccable.

But i hate the ending because it's open :)
