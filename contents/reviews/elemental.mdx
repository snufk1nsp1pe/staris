The child within me still **LOVES** animated movies.

Most of us have a stereotypical misconception about them; “they're intended for kids so surely
the plot is not that *wow*” we say. But these animated movies are in fact solid, with a core
and a meaning. 

I cried to <span className='decoration-dashed underline underline-offset-2 decoration-blue-500'>
<a href='https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/10681-wall-e?language=fr'>WALL·E (2008)</a></span>.
And so did I to Elemental.

Great depiction of pure emotion and struggle. Family bonds, identity, love, life in general.

At first i thought it's going to be 'corny' but they actually did make it rich with emotion,
the plot was consistent, watergirl and fireboy live-action AND they're falling in love? 
LET'S GO.

This review may seem a bit rushed but guess what, this movie inspired me to write something.
