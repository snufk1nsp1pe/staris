Love is elemental. 

takes shapes and forms, it shapes and transforms.

builds, wrecks, it's the bricks and the storms.

it's the water, the air, the land and the fire.

I drown, i suffocate, i'm buried and I'm scorched.

I'm slaked, I'm full, I bloom and I bask.

I gasp, yearn, grasp and burn; the crisp, the fresh, the dry and the stern.

I'm in the raging tide, what am I to do?

to fear, to hide, or to bravely ride?

i am in the roaring storm, what am i to do? 

to dread, to swarm, or to gallantly conform?

i am on the sinking sand, what am i to do? 

to shudder, to withstand, or to valiantly stand?

i am in the blazing flame, what am i to do? 

to quiver, to inflame, or to fiercely claim? 

I am calm, before that storm i am calm, serene, 

before that storm i kneel, 

what am i to do?

And then i rage. 

i rage and i rage and i rage. 

Roaring back, howling, like a star on a stage (Pearl 2022 reference). 

And then The storm is calm, before me that storm is calm, it seals, 

before me that storm kneels, 

what am i to do? I triumph, or so it seems. 

Stillness, silence, oh how i miss the violence.

By the shore i sit, i wonder, oh do i wish to surrender? 

The lightning, the thunder, oh how i crave to be under. 

By the shore i pine, i ponder, what am i to do? 

I become the shore. 

I am the shore, braced for your ocean,

craving a grip of the salt and the motion, 

oh wreck me with a delicate wave of devotion. 

Love is elemental. But is it mental? 

To drown or not to drown, that is the question. 

But can a shore ever drown? 

It's made to swallow the waves, not a single frown, 

to gently embrace, to hold its own ground.

But then there's the flood. 

The ocean is devoted, merely wants to hug, 

wave upon wave and the shore is sludge and mud. 

Wave upon wave it hits, calms, cradles and charms, slightly disarms. 

To hug back tight, or to flight? That is the question. 

To drown or not to drown? That is the question. 

To vanish, to dissolve, grain by grain? 

Or to replenish, to evolve, to not go in vain? 

Amidst the crisis the shore is both sane and insane. 

What am i to do? Thus i remain. I retract and refrain. 

The wave, the pain? I am of the rain. 

Further I crawl. 

I crawl and i crawl and i crawl. 

The rain, the wave? I am of the cave. 

The cold, the stone, a tick and a flame. 

A flick and a reframe. 

Love is mental, yet it is also temperamental. 

Once rough, once gentle. Twice healing, twice detrimental.
