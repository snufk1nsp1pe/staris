This is Serine, the creator of Staris.

I'm confused about what to write in here, who am I? it's hard to tell who a person really is, let alone describing one's self to complete strangers who probably wouldn't even bother reading this.

But since you read up until here then i take it that you're curious enough for me to reveal my secret identity to you :)

I'm a cyber security undergrad student from algeria, I have a thing for web development *(I'm in love with next.js)*, cinema, literature, art, and anything that screams **life**. Oh and I use Arch Linux btw.

I made this 'blog' in about a week because I had an urge to do so, so that I could have an outspoken voice without actually doing the talking *(some would call it autism)*, so you'll find random thoughts in here about anything that I feel like talking about, especially movie reviews.

**ENJOY &lt;3**


{/* **Hello there :)**
    
Long story short; one random summer evening i was running random
linux commands *(i use arch btw)*, then i had a random interesting
thought like i always do, followed by another; *”why don't i
make my own blog?”* because my thoughts are really interesting, and i
need to bother people with them, so here we are.

I present to you the weirdest and the wildest, neatly structured *(i
hope)*, as much as i love to write i also like to yap so buckle up
and read on :D

As i was saying, i dropped the linux commands right away *(i use arch
btw)* and rushed to my best friend; chatGPT. Straight to the point i
queried: *“tech stack needed for a blog?”* and he happily obliged. I
found out, after a wild couple of weeks battling react [<a href='https://theatre-gny2.vercel.app'><span className='inline text-red underline decoration-[#f9e3e9] hover:underline hover:decoration-[#B83555] decoration-2 transition-all duration-300 ease-out underline-offset-4 '>yes i have another react project<ArrowUpRight width={15} height={15} className='inline ml-1 mb-2 hover:fill-[B83555]'/></span></a>], that he had a twin sister! Next.js!. I've heard of Next.js
before, to be honest it reminded me of a ninja, and upon learning it
i realized it is in fact as stealthy as a ninja, it's fast and
does the job done, like a serial killer to be precise. */}
